//Stack and Heap
//Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).
//Heap is a memory used by programming languages to store global variables. It is a large pool of memory used to store objects, and it manages memory allocation and deallocation for you.
